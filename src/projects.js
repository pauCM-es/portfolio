      `- CRUD of data from quality checks the produce received at warehouse entrance. (It's known as "escandallo")`,
      `- Possibility of taking pictures of the fruit batch of each escandallo, and upload them to cloudinary.`,
      `- Catalogue of defects, plages the fruit can suffer, and that the worker has to check for. Another CRUD.`,
      `- A chat section between users so the worker doesn't need to use their personal phone.`,
      `- User roles: reader, writer, admin (this can register and modify users).`,
      `- We wanted for input data to be fast. to try and not to use much the keyboard: dynamicaly generated buttons, radio and range inputs, the use of
      key intro to add data... `,
      `- Design thinking in scalability. In case of diferent products, growing and having more warehouses. 
      Being able to filter wich warehouse data shoud each user see and work with...`,

      `- This one is a pet project of mine so I'm going to keep developing it and learn from it. WHAT'S NEXT: `,
      `- Improve the chat and make it completed fuctional between diferent users.`,
      `- Improve the catalogue. When creating a new defect, the posibility of take a photo and save it.`,
      `- Another section for instructions and protocols so the worker can be more independent.`,
      `- Being able to export to .cvs, excel.`,
      `- Generate reports in PDF.`,
      `- Make it responsive.`,
