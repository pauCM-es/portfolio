    On this first project, the main challange was mostly the planning. How to structure the html and
    css classes applying the BEM methodology, while keeping in mind the responsive aspect of the page, so 
    the coding part would be faster and cleaner.`,

    Use of poke-API fetchs (async/await). The requirement of this project was fetching the info and do 
    some layout manipulating the DOM. I saw a lot of possibilities with the tools learned, and tried to 
    apply everything I could with the available time like: imports and exports, creating my own function helpers, 
    use of ES6 features, git, clean and organize code...
    There are still unfinish things and some bugs, but I'm really proud of what I managed to achieve.
    P.S. There is a way to catch them all!! You need to watch for the last unseen pokemon.`,

    This was a really hard one even if it is a really simple API. It is suppose to save the 
    differents settings the user configures their 3d printer for the diferent designs.
    There are restrictions for user not logged in. And also a little scrapping done and implemented with a post request, using the library puppeteer to recolect 
    the info (title, image url, link url) of the designs I saved as favourites on my account of a free webpage where most of 
    us print our thingies.
    The idea came beacause I'm incapable of remember what settings I used or what I shoud use for new prints. 
    So if I could get ideas of other users or remember mine by selecting a design, it would be quite helpfull.
